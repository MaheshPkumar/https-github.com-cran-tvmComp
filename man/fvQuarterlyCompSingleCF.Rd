\description{
Computing Future Value of a Single Cash Flow for Quarterly Compounding Frequency.
}
\details{
According to \insertCite{brook;textual}{tvmComp},Future Value is the value of an asset at a specific point in time in the future that is equivalent in value to a specific amount today. So there exists a direct relationship between the Future Value of an asset and the assetâ€™s Present Value, growth rate and time to the future point. Future values grow faster due to the fact that interest also keeps on earning interest, a phenomenon called Compounding of Interest.
The method \code{fvQuarterlyCompSingleCF()} is developed to compute Future Value of a Single Cash Flow for Quarterly Compounding Frequency.The method gives Future Value when values are passed to its three arguments. Here \code{r} is annual rate, \code{n} is number of years and \code{pv} is Present Value.
